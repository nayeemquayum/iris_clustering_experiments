#We'll apply k means (iris_kmeans.py) clustering on iris data set

#iris_kmeans.py
We first ran kmean clustering for 1 to 10 clusters and calculated their inertia. Then, we plotted
inertia against cluster numbers and using elbow method discovered 3 as the optimal number of cluster.
Finally, we made a plot with petal width and petal length on 3 clusters to see graphical result.
#breast_cancer_knn.py
We ran knn clustering on the breast cancer dataset.
